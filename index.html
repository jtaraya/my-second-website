          <p>
            Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The city and its
            surrounding area also form the Nairobi County. The name -Nairobi-
            comes from the Maasai phrase ‘Enkare Nyrobi’, which translates to
            -cool water-

          <p>
            Nanyuki is a town in central Kenya. It's known as a gateway to Mount
            Kenya and the wilderness of Mount Kenya National Park. Several
            trails, including the Naro Moru and Sirimon routes, ascend the
            mountain. The park’s wildlife includes leopards, giant forest hogs
            and more than 100 bird species. Northwest of Nanyuki, the plains and
            hills of the vast Laikipia Plateau are home to lions, elephants and
            rare Grevy’s zebras.
